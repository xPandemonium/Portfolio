          My full name is Jonathan Correa Iglesias. I am in my early 20s. I was born in Havana, Cuba but now I'm in Houston, Texas where I was raised and currently live. 
          I've been working as a Diesel Technician for over 4 years.
          I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development program.
          So far, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript React, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, and setting up and connecting to APIs.
          I am a very hard working and dedicated person. I am always looking to improve myself and learn new things.
          I am a very quick learner and like to take inspiration from wherever I can. Always open to criticism and feedback as I believe that is the best way to grow.
