## Description

This is a personal portfolio website I created to showcase my work as a Full Stack Developer. It includes a selection of my projects, a resume with a summary of my skills, an about me section, and a contact form. The site is fully responsive and built using modern web technologies, such as Tailwind CSS and React, to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience across all devices.
